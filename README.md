# Brute_Force
This script can be useful for any brute force attacks against websites.
There are something which should be changed such as ; 1) you need to change the URL path ( the website which you want to brute), 
2) and the wordlist whereby you want to use it. (rockyou.txt, seclists,own pass lists etc...)


usuage is really simple :

python3 brute_force.py and boom however, keep in your mind open that python file and change it.
